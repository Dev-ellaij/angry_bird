## The process

### Built with

- Flutter and Dart

### Lesson learnt

Developing the Angry Bird mobile game app provided several valuable insights and lessons, both technical and non-technical, these lessons are summarized in the following bullet point:

- The value of team work and collaboration.
Developers were paired in a team of five to work together to bring this project idea to live.
- Understanding game engine of flutter
The development provided insight to flutter game engine using flame and forge2D.

- Effective UI/UX Design
Creating a user-friendly interface involved using various Flutter widgets to provide a smooth and responsive experience. The pull-to-refresh feature and shimmer loading effect were particularly effective in improving the user experience by providing visual feedback during data loading.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code: Recommended for development and testing
- A device or emulator to run the app

### Setup Instructions

1.**Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/angry_bird.git
   ```
  
2.**Navigate to the project directory**

## Flame and Forged2D

Flutter Flame is an open-source, community-built game engine for Flutter that helps developers build games that require collision, maps, and a game loop. It's a minimalist engine that combines the simplicity of its component system with Flutter's power.

Forge2D is a 2D physics engine for Dart that's based on the open-source Box2D physics engine. It's designed for games and can be used independently in Dart or in a Flame project.

## UI/UX

Angry Bird provides an Intuitive and user-friendly interface:

- Splash Screen: Displays an icon and app name while initializing.
- Level Screen: Players can select the levle they want to play in the game.
- Home Screen: The home screen provides player option to leader board for scores of other users and option for going to game settings.
- Game Screen: The game screen provide an Intuitive and amazing gaming experience for players as they can interact with the bird to destroy bricks .
- Sound and Visual Effect: The game provides background sound and effect sound when the bird collides with obstacles or enemies.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced Error Handling: Improving error handling mechanisms to provide more informative feedback to the users.
- Testing: Incorporating unit and integration tests to ensure the app's reliability and catch potential issues early.
- Performance Optimization: Optimizing the app's performance, particularly in handling more levels and user interaction, to ensure a smooth user experience.
- User Feedback: Gathering user feedback and iterating on the app's features and design based on real-world usage.
- Scalability: Preparing the app for scalability to handle more users, and potential new features in the future.
